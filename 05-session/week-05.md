# Week 05 – Agile, Scrum, and the Role of the Scrum Master

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Agile mindset and principles  
- Overview of the Scrum framework and its ceremonies  
- Roles within a Scrum team: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team  
- Responsibilities and soft skills of the Scrum Master  
- Workshop: building a tower using Scrum methodology to simulate teamwork and iteration  

## 🧰 Tools & Setup
- Microsoft Teams / Miro board for collaboration and sprint planning  
- Scrum artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment  
- Physical materials for the workshop (tower-building exercise)  
- Notion / Trello for task tracking and sprint retrospectives  

## 🧩 Workshop: Building the Tower
The workshop simulated a real Scrum sprint:  
- Sprint 1: Planning phase — defining objectives, materials, and constraints  
- Sprint 2: Building phase — rapid prototyping and communication  
- Sprint 3: Review — testing tower stability and adapting design  
- Retrospective — discussing lessons learned and how teamwork improved  

The Scrum Master played a key role as facilitator, ensuring collaboration,
removing blockers, and helping the team self-organize effectively.

## 💡 Insights
- Agile values collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement  
- The Scrum Master is not a manager but a **servant leader** — guiding the process, not controlling it  
- Clear communication and short feedback loops lead to better results  
- The tower exercise illustrated how iteration and adaptation beat perfect planning  
- Real teamwork emerges when everyone focuses on the sprint goal rather than individual tasks
