# Week 01 – Cloud Computing Fundamentals & AZ-900 Preparation

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to **Cloud Computing** concepts: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
- Overview of **Microsoft Azure** and its core services.
- Understanding cloud models (Public, Private, Hybrid).
- Key principles of **Azure architecture**: regions, availability zones, resource groups.
- Azure account management, subscriptions, and pricing.
- Basics of security, compliance, and governance in the cloud.
- Prepared for the **AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals** certification exam.

## 🧰 Tools & Setup
- Access provided to **Office 365** and a **personalized institutional email**.
- Setup of the Microsoft learning environment and Azure portal access.
- Orientation on how to use Microsoft Learn and related Azure documentation.

## 🧑‍💻 Code & Examples
*(No code this week, focus was conceptual and platform-based setup)*  
Still, explored the Azure Portal interface and practiced creating basic resources (VMs, storage accounts).

## 🔍 Case Studies / Exercises
- Hands-on with Azure Portal: resource creation and management.
- Exercises comparing IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS examples.
- Cost calculator exploration for Azure services.

## 💡 Insights
- Realized how cloud concepts parallel software architecture: **scalability**, **resource abstraction**, and **automation** feel similar to modular design in dev work.
- The shift from CapEx (Capital Expenditure) to OpEx (Operational Expenditure) in cloud economics reframes how IT infrastructure is managed.
- Having prior dev experience helped grasp Azure services logic faster.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Deepen understanding of Azure compute and storage services.
- Continue practicing with Azure portal.
- Review mock tests and prep materials for the **AZ-900 exam** scheduled at the end of the Cloud Computing module.
