# Week 06 – Azure DevOps, MLOps, SecOps, and Web App Delivery

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Azure DevOps and its core services  
- Understanding DevOps, MLOps, and SecOps practices  
- Pipelines, Repos, Boards, and CI/CD concepts  
- Secure development practices integrated into DevOps workflows  
- Using Azure DevOps to deliver a real project: a web app for a sports club  

## 🧰 Tools & Setup
- Azure DevOps organization and project workspace  
- Repos for source control and branching strategy  
- Azure Pipelines for CI/CD automation  
- Azure Boards for task management and sprint visibility  
- Security integration tools (checks, approvals, secure pipelines)  
- Web App hosting on Azure (App Service)  

## 🧑‍💻 Project Work: Sports Club Web App
We used Azure DevOps to manage the entire workflow:
- Planning the features using Azure Boards  
- Pushing the source code to Azure Repos  
- Setting up a CI pipeline to build and test the app  
- Creating a CD pipeline to deploy updates automatically  
- Adding security rules, validations, and permissions as part of SecOps  
- Final deployment of the web app to Azure App Service  

The project helped connect theory with hands-on DevOps practice.

## 🔍 Case Studies / Exercises
- Defined Epics, User Stories, and Tasks for the sports club app  
- Implemented a Git workflow (main/dev/feature branches)  
- Built automated CI pipelines with build triggers  
- Configured CD to deploy to a test environment, then production  
- Integrated security checks to enforce safe deployments  
- Explored how DevOps connects to MLOps workflows for AI-driven apps  

## 💡 Insights
- DevOps improves delivery speed by automating everything from code to deployment  
- MLOps extends DevOps to machine learning models, focusing on reproducibility and monitoring  
- SecOps ensures security stays part of the pipeline, not an afterthought  
- Azure DevOps gives a single environment for code, planning, collaboration, and deployment  
- Real projects show how CI/CD reduces manual errors and increases consistency
