## 🧰 Tools & Setup
- Microsoft Fabric workspace (Lakehouse, Data Engineering Experience)  
- OneLake storage and Delta tables  
- Power BI for visualization  
- Azure SQL Database (for relational demo)  
- Visual Studio Code and GitHub for notes and project tracking  

## 🧑‍💻 Code / Example
```text
Bronze → Raw Data → collected from multiple sources  
Silver → Cleaned Data → validated and transformed  
Gold → Business Data → aggregated for analytics & ML
This Bronze–Silver–Gold pipeline illustrates how the Lakehouse keeps
data organized for reliability and re-use.
